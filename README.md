ABOUT THE PROJECT:

🌦 Visualization of Weather Forecast in Python

This is a python programming internship project. It shows how you can make use of a public API, get live weather data, and graph it using Python libraries.

📌 Project Overview

The script makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to get the 24-hour weather report of the user selected city (for example: Chennai). It analyzes the data to obtain:

Forecast times

Temperatures (in °C)

Weather (cloudy, rainy, etc.)

Finally, a line chart is prepared with the help of Matplotlib.

📈 Features

🔗 Pulls data of updated forecast from an open API

📊 Get temperature and weather description snippets

🌡 Extract hot temperatures (>32°C)

📉 Shows how temperature is changing over time

💾 Ability to save the graph as an image (forecast. png)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python 3

requests – for sending HTTP requests

matplotlib : for data visualization.

Google Colab – to write and execute code (optional)

⚙ How to Run This Project

1. Install dependencies:

pip install requests matplotlib

Run the Python script:

python weather_task.py
